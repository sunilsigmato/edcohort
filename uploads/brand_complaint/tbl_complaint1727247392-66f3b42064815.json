We recieved learning station on one day and books on the other day around 10 days later. when we asked executives as we can't access kid's performance with out having books so please consider 15 days trial once we recieved the books. Excutive said ok. after that the real tourches ts. 8 year kid can't attend the class on his own and wee dont have time to sit with him to cancel the program as 15 days aren't completed. then executive said the program ts when we recieve the learning station, hence cancellation request was denied. later i told to executives that there is no such clauses mentioned before registration but no one is there to accept that. apart from this we booked a session on Friday 16:00 Hrs and we made 20 mins call to schedule that slot, but on Saturday at 15:30 they scheduled session to Sunday 13:00 Hrs. this is how they will give freedom to you to re schedule their online sessions.","11":{"date":"2023-07-06 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2023-07-09 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":173},{"0":"K-12","1":"Byjus","2":"Online","3":"School","4":"AI\/ML","5":2022,"6":1,"7":"Priyanka0717@outlook.com","8":"Priyanka Mahale","9":"I received a call from one of their representatives explaining me about the course","10":"I received a call from one of their representatives explaining me about the course.

My child and I sat there for 10 minutes until another woman with an Indian accent came on and told me that they would not be able to provide a teacher and that they would have to reschedule my child's class.

While we appreciate the efforts of our faculty members, we continue to encounter significant challenges with the coordination and support provided by the Imarticus team, particularly our course coordinator, Monika Mali. Despite our repeated attempts to seek clarification and support, we have not received any response or acknowledgment from Monika Mali or any other responsible party. This lack of communication has left us feeling neglected and frustrated. Furthermore, the promised placement assistance, which was a crucial aspect of our agreement, has not been fulfilled. We have not received any suitable opportunities or interview schedules within the agreed timeframe of three months post-course completion. This has caused immense disappointment and anxiety among our batchmates. The issues we have faced include: - False promises regarding guaranteed placement assistance as per our agreement. - Lack of proper attendance and support during the course duration. - Delay in scheduling interviews and providing suitable job opportunities. - Unfulfilled commitments and higher fees charged with false promises. - Inadequate communication and lack of transparency from the faculty and coordination team. - Differential fee structures within the same batch, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction.","11":{"date":"2024-04-28 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2024-05-07 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":427},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"Imarticus","2":"Online","3":"","4":"AI\/ML","5":2024,"6":4,"7":"Riddhi4164@aol.com","8":"Riddhi Nagrecha","9":"Helpful and supportive: To be honest it is overall a great experience","10":"Helpful and supportive: To be honest it is overall a great experience, at first I was scared to do but it has been a great experience so far ,here the trainer and staff are very helpful and they will support you no matter what .","11":{"date":"2023-12-28 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2024-01-02 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":428},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"Imarticus","2":"Online","3":"","4":"AI\/ML","5":2023,"6":5,"7":"Prashant2251@hotmail.com","8":"Prashant Gaikwad","9":"I recently completed the IITR ACDMM ONLN-02 program at Imarticus Learning","10":"I recently completed the IITR ACDMM ONLN-02 program at Imarticus Learning.

I am deeply dissatisfied with the service provided by Imarticus in relation to the cancellation of my loan. Despite the approval of my loan cancellation more than two years ago, there has been no progress, and the situation has only worsened. My initial concerns were raised in a review about a month ago, to which Imarticus responded, promising a quick resolution. Unfortunately, there has been no follow-up or progress since then. I have diligently submitted all required documents via email, as per their requests, but there has been no acknowledgment or update on the status of my case. To make matters worse, I am now receiving multiple calls from Credence Finance, the loan company involved, which I consider a form of harassment. This not only reflects poorly on Imarticus's professionalism but also adds unnecessary stress to an already frustrating situation. I implore Imarticus to take immediate action to clear the outstanding amount and resolve this matter promptly. The lack of communication and the delay in processing my loan cancellation is causing significant distress, and I am now contemplating legal action to address this issue. By sharing my experience, I hope others considering Imarticus are aware of the potential challenges they may face.

There were several disappointments that I believe need addressing. False Marketing and Unmet Expectations: The marketing team promised great things for my future, but unfortunately, the reality fell short. The coaching material was substandard, and the overall experience didn\u2019t match the initial hype. Job Assistance and Career Growth: I expected better job assistance after completing the certification. However, the support provided didn\u2019t lead to meaningful job opportunities. It\u2019s essential to manage expectations regarding job placement. Certifications alone won\u2019t guarantee success; practical skills and a strong portfolio matter more, which Simplilearn fails to offer. Self-Work and Free Resources: I realized that building a portfolio and gaining practical experience are crucial steps beyond certification. Many free resources, such as YouTube courses, can supplement formal learning without hefty fees. In summary, there\u2019s room for improvement. Learners should approach it with realistic expectations and supplement their learning with additional resources.","11":{"date":"2024-06-30 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2024-07-07 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":593},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"simplilearn","2":"Online","3":"College","4":"IT and Networking","5":2022,"6":5,"7":"Lakshmi1790@yahoo.com","8":"Lakshmi Subramanian","9":"I've really enjoyed the Simplilearn platform and working with Simplilearn overall","10":"I've really enjoyed the Simplilearn platform and working with Simplilearn overall, and I really liked having recorded lectures to use as a reference after the sessions were over.

I want to share my experience. Before enrolling in their course, they painted a rosy picture and influenced me to take up the course again and again calling me. I enrolled in March 2023 for an MBA in Logistics and Supply Chain, with 6 months of online study at that time i was working at Amazon, Bangalore. and the remaining 1 year in Germany. However, they promised provide to full assistance through my visa file and on campus which turned out to be false. The visa team at upGrad did not review my file properly and my visa got rejected twice. I had to seek help from an agent, costing me 70k. They misled students by assuring a quick course completion and assistance with visa applications to relocate to Germany. Now, I am pursuing the course from India because I have no other choice and it lacks practical knowledge in the online sessions. Based on my experience, Me and my friends regrets getting enrolled at upGrad. I recommend exploring alternative platforms and conducting thorough research before making any decisions, as it could save you both time and money to avoid using any services from Upgard. Doing so may result in unnecessary costs and a waste of time.","11":{"date":"2024-06-12 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2024-06-17 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":733},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"Upgrad","2":"Online","3":"College","4":"AI\/ML","5":2022,"6":1,"7":"Steve6157@hotmail.com","8":"Steve Gates","9":"I have registered for the Azure Developer Training program in February 2024","10":"I have registered for the Azure Developer Training program in February 2024.

Despite the hefty amount paid, the return on investment fell short by a large margin. One of the most glaring issues was the abysmal placement support. For experienced professionals like myself looking to transition into the digital marketing field, this was particularly disappointing. The lack of personalized guidance and assistance left me feeling stranded and uncertain about my career prospects.Moreover, the course heavily relied on pre-recorded content, constituting a whopping 75% of the curriculum. This not only diminished the interactive aspect of learning but also hindered the acquisition of practical knowledge. As someone eager to gain hands-on experience and real-world skills, this was a major letdown.Overall, I would strongly advise against enrolling in this course, especially for those with prior experience in other industries seeking a career shift into digital marketing. The exorbitant fees simply do not justify the lackluster value and support provided.

Course duration will be 8-8.5 Months. Advanced Certificate Programme in Data Science. Looking at this ad you will calculate 3000*9 months. = 27000. but you need to scroll so much down, there it is mentioned fees as 1 lakh rupees.<br>moreover, its so highly charged in the industry, their counseler will call you for the seat block amount, or pay full fees. so most of us go for emi option.<br>Here what they do is they give you all the promises that you give the seat block amount as downpayment, and remaining we will convert it as emi. so Here is a major trap. once you give them downpayment amount, you are stuck , they will say that your emi conversion loan is not processing due to multiple issues, and say that seat block amount will not be refunded.

You will see daily some positive reviews due to this scam. Moreover, they make fake promises of guaranteed placements after completion of the course which is another blunder done by them. The prices of the courses are relatively high due to the usage of IIT brand name but ultimately they don't teach any subject to its depth due to which after completion you will feel that you have wasted so much time for such horrible things. Finally, once you pay the entire course fee, you cant get your course fee back even if you try very hard.

It's a scam. I wanted to enrol for the Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH) course. I enquired and got a call from one of the course advisors named Shalom. She explained the details but I had a pricing challenge. Then she transferred the call to her manager Rajat. He said that 42000 is the least that we can offer but Intellipaat will give you an AZ500 course too as an add-on. I said I will think about it. I kept on getting calls from Shalom and Rajat. I asked Shalom if they can also provide a GCP course as an add-on to which she said she needs to discuss with management first. She discussed it internally and confirmed that they would give a GCP online course which meant I could avail of the live classes too. I asked her to confirm this in an email and she confirmed in the email too. So, I made the payment and finished my enrollment for the CEH course considering that I would get the other 2 courses too. As soon as I enrolled, Rajat dropped an email to the support team asking them to provide course access to CEH, GCP and AZ500 and they provided the course access. But after a day or 2, he dropped another email asking the support team to remove the access to both GCP and AZ500 courses. He must have thought that I won't notice it. But I saw it immediately and called him. He didn't pick up my call. But after several attempts, he picked up my call and said that we couldn't provide you access to the AZ500 and GCP online course. Our management had denied and they are saying in this money we could only offer CEH. I said, but you confirmed this on call and email too. He said yes I did but now I can't provide the access and my access to both GCP online and AZ500 was removed from my portal. This is how they cheat students. To get the enrollment done, they would say that we would provide some additional courses too. The students would find the additional courses worth it and make the payment even after the fact that they were initially hesitant to make the payment. Now, imagine they are making some commitment via call and email then how can they deny that after a student made payment according to that commitment? This is not only unethical and unprofessional but I would call it a scam. It means that whatever they are saying not only on call but also in the email is all a lie. I urge every student to not enrol with Intellipaat. They are not running a company. I think it's some roadside 'Lala ki dukan'. Please avoid this institute and save your hard-earned money guys. These guys can't be trusted. And, I don't know what kind of classes quality I would get in the classes. If the institute is such the tutors would be like that only. The Intellipaat support team has asked to share the order details so that they can check it. Though I don't have any belief that they would help me out but still; my invoice number is B2C\/MAY24\/00464 experience on May 16, 2024.","11":{"date":"2024-10-07 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2024-10-10 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":986},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"Intellipaat","2":"Online","3":"College","4":"AI\/ML","5":2022,"6":1,"7":"Archana0816@aol.com","8":"Archana Murali","9":"No 1 scam institute in the India","10":"No 1 scam institute in the India.

However, the support and the idea of the whole academy is great, but it\u2019s the bulk of learners who spoil the whole experience. There is a constant bugging and disturbance from non career oriented students who disrupt the class and sway the teachers into a constant threshold of justification for their insecurities. I have sadly invested a 1000$ here and have not got my moneys worth of results. After almost a year I am still switching their courses and relying on their hope giving. But this is a slippery slope. I am very sad and how this has turned out to be. I would suggest the Intellipaat management to introduce more rules and discipline in their online classes. This is one of my suggestions.

I promptly reached out to Ganesh who sold the course to me to request a refund, providing all necessary documentation and information. However, despite assurances that the refund would be processed by the finance team and the escalation team (Samarth and Nischay,) it has now been 6 months and I have still not received my money back. They are now coming up with new excuses that they have not received the money and that the advisor has transferred the money to his personal account and all kinds of baseless talks after confirming receipt of money last year. As a customer, I expect to be treated fairly and with respect, especially when it comes to financial matters. I urge others to exercise caution when dealing with Intellipat, as my experience has been far from satisfactory, it is frustrating and I wonder where the education system is going now. It's disheartening to see such disregard for customer satisfaction and basic business ethics.","11":{"date":"2024-02-06 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2024-02-09 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":998},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"Intellipaat","2":"Online","3":"College","4":"IT and Networking","5":2023,"6":1,"7":"Vekash0476@outlook.com","8":"Vekash","9":"Arrogant Behavior of Executives","10":"Arrogant Behavior of Executives.... pls search for some other direct IIT based course not thru this intellipaat.","11":{"date":"2024-01-27 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2024-02-05 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":999},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"Intellipaat","2":"Online","3":"College","4":"Other","5":2022,"6":5,"7":"Basavaraj8367@outlook.com","8":"Basavaraj Hiremath","9":"Fantastic issue resolved","10":"Fantastic issue resolved","11":{"date":"2023-10-12 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2023-10-20 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":1000},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"Intellipaat","2":"Online","3":"College","4":"IT and Networking","5":2022,"6":4,"7":"Paresh4850@outlook.com","8":"Paresh Chavande","9":"Great learning experience with Intellipaat","10":"Great learning experience with Intellipaat.","11":{"date":"2023-09-30 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2023-10-01 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":1001},{"0":"Working Prof","1":"Intellipaat","2":"Online","3":"College","4":"AI\/ML","5":2024,"6":1,"7":"Amit1138@aol.com","8":"Amit Tiwari","9":"Not Good","10":"Not Good.

Here's my honest opinion: The teachers are just excellent, every concept is explained properly and in detail, the mcqs they provide are very helpful and at the end of the class sometimes practice sheets are given. This makes the topic just a lot easier for the students. During live classes every doubt is taken into account and teachers are very cooperative. But, the timing of most the classes are not according to the schedule given and clashing. From 18th of november our history class started which was supposed to be held from 4-5 pm according to the schedule was held from 3-4pm which clashes with two other classes pol sc and numerical ability or reasoning classes. You have no option but to attend only one class and miss the other two classes. Besides the recordings are given very late. You have no other option but to be stuck in a backlog for a long time. It's been 1 week but still no changes has been made in the schedule to make it easier for the students to do class on the proper time. Thus, take into account all these things before purchasing the course.","11":{"date":"2022-11-19 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2022-11-22 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":1125},{"0":"Test Prep","1":"Adda247","2":"Online","3":"College","4":"AI\/ML","5":2023,"6":4,"7":"singhvaibhav46vs6230@gmail.com","8":"singhvaibhav46vs","9":"These people are doing scam with students","10":"These people are doing scam with students.

In June 2023, I was excited to embark on a journey towards preparing for the Uttarakhand Judiciary Exam. With great enthusiasm, I decided to invest my time and hard-earned money into Unacademy's highly-touted three-month live + recorded online class batch, which promised to be the gateway to their success. However, what followed was nothing short of a horrendous nightmare. First and foremost, I paid a hefty sum of \u20b99499 for a course that was marketed as a three-month live online class batch. The anticipation was palpable as they eagerly awaited the commencement of their studies. However, the reality couldn't have been farther from the promises made by Unacademy. Instead of the classes I paid for, I was provided with the incomplete pre-recorded lectures and no live classes which they promised. This wasn't what I signed up for; wanting a dynamic, interactive experience of live classes to help her grasp the complex concepts required for the Judiciary Exam. It was evident that Unacademy was using these subpar recordings as a placeholder for their lack of expertise and commitment. As if that weren't infuriating enough, the situation took a turn for the worse when I tried to contact Unacademy for clarification and resolution. Shockingly, Unacademy simply chose to ignore all my pleas for assistance. Emails went unanswered, and phone calls were met with silence. And after non-stop efforts to reach the Unacademy help, they refused to refund the amount, stating no refund policy even when they did not fulfill the purpose for which my hard earned money was given. It is as if Unacademy believes they can take people's money and disappear into thin air without any consequences. Unacademy's actions are not just a disappointment; they are a disgrace. They are cheating students with their empty promises, demonstrating a complete lack of integrity and commitment to their customers. My hard-earned money has been squandered on a service that has proven to be nothing short of a scam. In conclusion, I urge anyone considering Unacademy for their educational needs to think twice. They do not have the caliber or ethics to deliver on their promises. I have been left cheated, disillusioned, frustrated, and her crucial time has been wasted, which also impacted my self-study preparation, and I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone else. Stay far away from Unacademy and save your money for an educational institution that actually values its students and delivers on its commitments.","11":{"date":"2023-09-08 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2023-09-09 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":1213},{"0":"Test Prep","1":"Unacademy","2":"Offline","3":"College","4":"Developer","5":2023,"6":1,"7":"rominrangara3147@gmail.com","8":"rominrangara","9":"Unacademy","10":"Unacademy.com has proven to be a priceless tool for my educational endeavors.

Most of the exam preparation have been covered under that like UPSC, CAT, GATE, BANK PO etc. It also provides a learning facility for school-going students (class 9 to 12). The main plus point of this site is that it has very good and useful content plus a very interactive user interface. One thing more which I like is that you don't have to depend on a single content because you can get much content on the same topic by a number of faculties. So I'll recommend each and every aspirant to just go for it.","11":{"date":"2019-03-18 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2019-03-20 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":1321},{"0":"Test Prep","1":"Unacademy","2":"Offline","3":"College","4":"Developer","5":2023,"6":1,"7":"pjkaur4002@yahoo.com","8":"pjkaur","9":"Their app undergoes updates twice or thrice a week","10":"Their app undergoes updates twice or thrice a week.

Pros: Quality of teaching is good. There are good educators like Jatin Verma who have appeared for UPSC CSE exam. Ayush Sanghi sir is one of the best economics teachers. Mrunal Patel sir has also launched his courses which play an important role in civil service examination. These are some of the well-known educators on Unacademy. Video provides beautiful presentation with a limited span of time. There are various courses which give the opportunity to the audience to learn about various topics. Cons: Various content for single topic which makes the audience unable to make choices. Incompletion of courses. It is one of the worst things about Unacademy. Unacademy is one of the best apps but there is a scope for improvement. Coming to administration, it is quite good. There is hardly any error while operating on this app. It is user-friendly. User interface is excellent. I recommend you to use this app. I hope this review helps you.","11":{"date":"2018-12-24 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2018-12-25 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":1324},{"0":"Test Prep","1":"Unacademy","2":"Offline","3":"College","4":"AI\/ML","5":2024,"6":3,"7":"akshay_mani5308@outlook.com","8":"akshay_mani","9":"I came to know about this platform 10 months ago and I am thankful to all mentors who are guiding on Unacademy","10":"I came to know about this platform 10 months ago and I am thankful to all mentors who are guiding on Unacademy.

As a UPSC aspirant since 2016, I started following Unacademy from the beginning and now it become the key source for my preparation. This platform is undeniable for aspirants like me who because of some financial issue couldn't go for coaching institutions. The best thing I personally like about Unacademy is the educators on their platform, most of the educators are toppers of the UPSC examination, who can usher you better than the one who already gone through the hurdle and get through it like a champion. So guys its my strong recommendation that you should make best out of it by simply following and subscribing the Unacademy channel on YouTube.","11":{"date":"2018-11-13 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"12":{"date":"2018-11-16 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America\/New_York"},"row_index":1327},{"0":"Test Prep","1":"Unacademy","2":"Offline","3":"College","4":"AI\/ML","5":2022,"6":1,"7":"aayushkumar750282423@gmail.com","8":"aayushkumar75028","9":"I am a student","10":"I am a student.

SAMSUNG refused to service it by mentioning that it is a fake Chinese SAMSUNG product, and we will not offer any warranty or support for this product. Then I have called Extra Marks, and they suggested to send it to ExtraMarks Noida Office, I followed there instructions, After multiple chase they surprised me that its screen is broken, which neither SAMSUNG center mentioned neither I have observed before sending the parcel. And there whole team put complete blame on us and asked to take care by self. As a middle class family who already have his job responsibilities, thought to buy new mobile instead wasting time of my son. So after that I visited local stores to get new mobile for my son study, after a purchase when I inserted provided chips, it was not working with there App. Again I called to Extra marks, to seek help, but they refused by saying that it will work only in there provided tab. and cant help on this. Then I requested for an alternative, as its was like a burden for a middle class father. They told to use the online edition, here after really fed-up my son tried that also on his new mobile, which was getting hang frequently. Then came to know that actually they are not helping instead, focusing to steal our hard earned money on emotional grounds that they are making super heroes to our kids. Its just there own money making machine. So be aware and take decision, if you have excess time to experiments or spare money apart from school fee payments. Please go with them.

But I eager to know how i.e in what process they teach my child. He then explain they will take classes visually. At once they give demo to my child. But I cannot understand that science related subject can be possible to teach vissually. On the other hand rest subject such as geography, history, English, Bengali, Hindi, grammar will be learn as per usual method. They only give importance science subject. For this course they will provide a tab to the students, where they will use it only educational purpose. Total educational purpose they demand huge amount. This is one type of business. Give and take policy. I think education can not fulfill through money. In our childhood we were not used this type of technology.

It seemed ok, I looked around, and it seemed I should expect 50-60% of the fee. Fine, they do marketing, I do teaching, I like that. Or so I thought. I set up the program, looked all around, including promotions and discounts, everything looked good, put my standard $200 price tag on it. I\u2019ve been building this course and running it for 7 years. $200 is what students pay, so it wasn\u2019t like I was charging more or less. Same price. I got notified a few days later I had 4 students!! Awesome! I login, and see they are giving me $14. Total. Not per student. 4 students in a $200 class, and they want to pay me $14. That is less than 2% of what I set my price at. After reaching out, initially they tried to explain \"they have promotions, they sell from 10-200 unless we opt out\". As I said, I looked through promotions. That isn\u2019t where THAT promotion is. They have to explain to you how to opt-out, as they automatically opt you in. I still am waiting to hear back on how even 4x10 gets me only $14. They claimed they would look into it, but after a week of \u201cwe are busy, please wait\u201d, I explained either pay me the 50% of my full price, or remove my materials. \u201cwe are busy, please be patient\u201d. So I then just deleted them. Next day they claim I am violating their student guarantees for pulling my material down. They still never got back to me about how 4 sales of my $200 class, only get me $14. I did message every student who signed up, explaining how Udemy was trying to rip me off. I didn\u2019t want the students to be hurt, but I have a feeling Udemy blocked that message to the students. DO NOT BUY COURSES FROM THEM!! They rip off the creators, giving them peanuts, and expecting us to be happy with it. DO NOT CREATE COURSES ON THEM!!

I got excellent support for getting some discount codes when prices were too high. My purchases were high and also refunds. Refunds were requested because the course did not meet my expectations. Udemy has an apparent and unambiguous refund policy where if you are not satisfied for any reason, a refund will be processed with no questions asked. My recent purchase from Udemy was below standard and an outdated course. I wonder why Udemy cannot vet the instructors for their content. They want to promote some of the offered courses with no quality in mind. My request for a refund has been flagged. Their support process is very cumbersome. I finally managed to speak on a chat with a rep who seemed to understand my predicament and has escalated the issue for a refund.

Additional research done online as required by some courses and not included in the course itself. As well as the total time of the course being split up into multiple days of study instead of for example a one 8 hour day. Not even to mention lunch breaks etc. All of these factors and more just make us feel the time displayed on the certificate IS NOT the actual time spent on the course.

Be aware that Udemy fools you from the second you visit their website. Offers that 'only last 1 more day' actually last for the rest of the year and beyond.

We (4 people) have been scouting about 200 courses in the software and media development region. Most 'teachers' are so full of themselves, they actually forget to inform you about the 'do's and don't's' in software development. 42% of the 'teachers' approached, do not respond to questions, they just want (your) easy money. If you are looking for a place to learn about software or media development, this is definitely not the place to go. You're better of searching for stuff you really need on the web.

Within the platform a massive change had occurred in March 2020 but as the course was actually made three years ago it didn't deal with this change and it rendered a significant amount of the more advanced content pretty obsolete. So the course was sold on a lie. Finally, I was promised that I could watch the course on my TV. However, as Udemy aggressively pushes cookies my android TV won't let me open their website. So, I want to contact them about this and they have become uncontactable. No email, no Twitter DMs allowed, no telephone support. Not even quick chat.

This is fundamental to make sure you choose the right course, since not all of them are good and up to date. Unfortunately, the certificate you get after completing a course is not recognized, it's just a personal achievement, but what really matters is your actual knowledge. Another big advantage is the fact that you can buy just single courses with no need to pay for an annual or monthly subscription.

Turkey is fighting the economic crisis, and they are selling all courses to this country very cheaply. As a Canadian resident, I have to pay $98 more for the same course. Isn't that stupid?

As others have said the pricing is a total scam. They advertise a course at a heavily reduced price but then you add it to your cart and find the price has jumped by 400% (make sure you check or you will be in for a shock bill). Basically if you are already registered with them then you pay full price, new customers get the discount. Wouldn\u2019t mind if they made this clear but they don\u2019t, you see a reasonable price, add to cart and only at that point does the price rocket.

She is an awful on line tutor from the CADCIM institute, who keeps correcting herself, and has also submitted some videos which are technically unwatchable. She also offers no explanation for what she does, and it is only suitable to learn parrot style. That said, one or two of the techniques she has shown are proving useful. You have to have a lot of patience to get through this course as some of the lessons may have very little relevance to the general user.

Even escalations will not lead you anywhere (not sure why they have that provision). They will state that they will do a partial refund but that will never work (refer to many reviews from others - if you are lucky and survive the numerous attempts to get someone to respond, they only offer udemy credits and not give you back the money). Better use other education provider sites that are transparent on their pricing and have better support system.
